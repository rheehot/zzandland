# 20 popular behavioral questions from FAANG companies
## How would I answer the questions if I get them during an interview
<hr>

Last week, I wrote an article about core attributes that make up Googliness. This time, I will write my personal responses to some of the most popular behavioral questions from various companies. Please be mindful that my responses are tailored to reflect Googliness, and may not be suited as responses for other companies. I will continually update the article as I write each response.

I used *STAR method* to structure my responses. The STAR format stands for Situation, Task, Action, Result:
> - Situation: An event, project, or challenge faced
> - Task: Your responsibilities and assignments for the situation
> - Action: Steps or procedure taken to relieve or rectify situation
> - Result: Results of actions taken.

However, instead of *result*, I focused on stating what I **learned**, as *continually learning* is a core attribute that Google wants.

#### Amazon: Describe the project that you had the most trouble with. What would you have done differently?
The project that I had the most trouble with was when I built data pipelines and backfills to ingest data from Google and Facebook Ads platforms.

It originally started as a side project because we finished the main project for the quarter earlier than expected. There were two major challenges.

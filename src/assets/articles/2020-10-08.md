I got my bachelors in Biology in 2016, then spent next two years applying for dental schools without knowing what to do with my life. In 2018 April, after 2 consecutive years without getting accepted to any school, I decided to finally give up and explore coding, where I found my passion. 

Coding really helped me boost my self-confidence as I learned that I could actually be focused on a goal. Every night going back home from the local library that I always went, I started dreamt myself working at Google in Silicon Valley, which was a completely absurd dream. Why would any company in the Valley be willing to bring in a Canadian with no background in CS when there are plenty of new grads with  internships and research experience in NLP and computer vision who'd be dying to work in FANG?

I focused on learning frontend web development using React, then got my first job as a web developer in Toronto in Sep 2019 with a salary of 45k CAD. I was so happy that I could find a job finally, but then unprecendented event happend: COVID. My ex-company was especially hit hard as it was in real estates industry, and decided to reduce the headcount by half. I was laid-off immediately in April, which forced me to start studying again.

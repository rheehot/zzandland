### Do the right thing
  In other words, *don't do **evil** things*. Here are some of the keywords that you want to consider before the interview:

  > Positivity, Friendliness, Team Player, Transparent, Life Long Learner, Respectful, Valuing Yourself & Others, High Standards, Ethical, Humble, Committed, Trustworthy, Helpful, Integrity, Fun, Courteous, Caring, Passionate, Playful, Energetic, High EQ

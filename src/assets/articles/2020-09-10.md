As I have an upcoming *virtual* onsite interview with Google, I decided to write a post on what is **Googliness** based on various sources. Interestingly, many sources define Googliness in their own terms, so I tried my best to find core principles that are mentioned frequently. Here is a summary of what I found.

First of all, here are a list of *keywords* that you'd like to frame your answers with:
> Positivity, Friendliness, Team Player, Transparent, Life Long Learner, Respectful, Valuing Yourself & Others, High Standards, Ethical, Humble, Committed, Trustworthy, Helpful, Integrity, Fun, Courteous, Caring, Passionate, Playful, Energetic, High EQ

### Do the right thing
In other words, *don't do **evil** things*. Google strives to hire people who are honest and kind. Of course having good manner matters in any company, but it especially matters in Google. There are several ways that you can appeal that you are a good person who *does right thing* during the interview.

The first way is how you **interact** with people that you encounter during the hiring process, such as interviewers, recruiters, or even receptionists when you visit the office for onsite stage. Make sure to leave good impressions.

Second way is in the answers. Your answers should be completely **transparent** (~~not in a way that discloses your current company's secrets~~) and show a ton of **integrity**. If your answers reflect these two ideas, you will ace in behavioural questions.

### Choice of words
Using right words can make your answers strong and more customized to what Google is looking for. Three things to remember are: positivity, gender-free, and political-correctness.

Be **positive**. Positivity is very important in Google because negativity only brings people down. There are even some Googlers who do not respond to anything that is not positive. Make sure to use positive words in all of your answers. For example, instead of saying *problem*, you can phrase it as *opportunity*. *Mistake* can be worded to *learning opportunity*. When you talk about your failure, phrase it as how this *learning opportunity* has changed you to adapt and adjust your career. Googliness is about seeing everything positive.

Be careful with using **gender-specific** pronouns. Google employs more than 100,000 people with diverse backgrounds, including gender neutrals and non binaries. In 2017, Google faced a scandal when it fired a former engineer *James Damore* who claimed that biological differences between sexes are responsible for the lack of women in tech. As the company have gone through numerous controversies around the issue, it looks for candidates who do not have strong opinions on this. It is important to avoid describing anyone using gender specific pronouns like *he* or *she*. The easiest way to avoid this is by always using the actual name or just make up names in case if you do not remember.

Google is an incredibly liberal company where everyone is accepted. Your answers must be ethical and respectful to anyone.

### Laszlo's definition
Laszlo Block, a former VP of Google, defined Googliness as four attributes.

#### 1. Enjoying fun
Google employees work hard, but they also do love fun. If you can add anecdotes of how you *energized* your team through simple things like going for a pool with colleagues, it will definitely help you on the Googliness scale.

#### 2. Intellectual humility
It's hard to learn if you have hard time admitting that you might be wrong. Being humble and showing your commitment to growing more and helping others in your answers are good ways of showing intellectual humility. It also demonstrates how much curiosity you carry, which is a critical to make keen observations that lead to innovations. Stories such as helping others take lead, accepting advices of somebody else, or trusting your colleagues that they have the skill sets to do the job are good examples. Constantly talk about learning throughout the interview.

#### 3. Conscientiousness
Google looks for candidates with high standards. **Never make excuses** and own everything that you say during the interview. Talk about how you can improve and how you work through to get better throughout your career, like taking continuing education courses, reading books, or even as simple as improving your listening skills. Any sign of improving yourself constantly will score high on the scale.

#### 4. Interesting Path
This attribute is about taking courageous or interesting path in your life. Talk about how you made a challenging decision that made you learn lessons. The result is not important; what matters is the process itself and how much you have grown through it. Personally, I self-taught coding from 2018 and eventually ended up gaining a decent coding skill through self discipline and perseverance. Having a unique story or path is one thing that Google is looking for.

### Google's definition
This is how Google defines Googliness on their career's page:

#### 1. Working individually & team
Focusing on what you did and what you would do in answers is the top priority, but also be mindful of your team's strength. Giving credits to your team demonstrates that you are a team-player and how much you put importance on collaboration with others.

#### 2. How you help others
Caring and helping others is a core principle of Googliness that shines your leadership. Your story could be either personal or career-related and focus on talking about how you helped, listened, and showed empathy and compassion. Don't forget to mention what you learned from the experience.

#### 3. Ambiguity
Googliness is about finding joy and embracing uncertainty. Interviews will challenge your problem solving skills with limited information. Google looks for candidates who can positively respond and find joy in navigating unknown without being frustrated. Even if there is a bit of struggle and difficulties, if you can show positivity in tone and pitch, it's going to exhibit your fit for the company. Just try your best to navigate through the ambiguity throughout the interview.

#### 4. Pushing your comfort zone
Google wants to see if you strive to grow and learn. Stories like taking continuing education courses and stretching yourself to volunteer to a project that's outside of your skills and knowledge help, but showing growth during the interview really shines. Even if you struggle at beginning, if you can continue to work through it, it really shows how you push yourself out of the comfort zone.

#### 5. EQ
EQ is defined as:
> EQ is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict.

Having high EQ is highly correlated with Googliness. Try to empathize with interviewers and have a good *vibe* with them.

I know that it's been a long article to read, but I tried my best to summarize the core principles for a Google interview. If you can frame your stories around these ideas, you will be doing an excellent job on the interview day. Thanks for reading!

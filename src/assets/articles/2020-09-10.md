As I have an upcoming *virtual* onsite interview with Google, I decided to write a post on what is **Googliness** based on various sources. Interestingly, many sources define Googliness in their own terms, so I tried my best to find core principles that are mentioned frequently. Here is a summary of what I found.

First of all, here are a list of *keywords* that your responses should reflect:
> Positivity, Friendliness, Team Player, Transparent, Life Long Learner, Respectful, Valuing Yourself & Others, High Standards, Ethical, Humble, Committed, Trustworthy, Helpful, Integrity, Fun, Courteous, Caring, Passionate, Playful, Energetic, High EQ

### Do the right thing
In other words, *don't do **evil** things*. Google strives to hire people who are honest and kind. Of course having good manners is important in every company, but it especially matters in Google. There are several ways that you can appeal that you are a good person who *does right thing* during the interview.

The first way is how you **interact** with people that you encounter during the hiring process, such as interviewers, recruiters, or even receptionists when you visit the office for onsite stage. Make sure to leave good impressions.

Second way is in the answers. Your answers should be completely **transparent** and demonstrate your **integrity**. If your answers reflect these two ideas, you will ace in behavioural questions.

### Choice of words
Using right words can make your answers strong and more customized to what Google is looking for. Three things to remember are: positivity, gender-free, and political-correctness.

Be **positive**. Positivity is very important in Google because negativity only brings people down. Some Googlers may not respond to anything that is negative. Make sure to use positive words in all of your answers. For example, instead of saying *problem*, you can phrase it as *opportunity*. *Mistake* can be worded to *learning opportunity*. When you talk about your failure, phrase it as how this *learning opportunity* has changed you to adapt and adjust your career. Googliness is about seeing everything positive.

Be careful with using **gender-specific** pronouns. Google employs more than 100,000 people with diverse backgrounds, including gender neutrals and non binaries. In 2017, Google faced a scandal when it fired a former engineer *James Damore* when he claimed that lack of women in tech is due to biological differences between sexes. As the company have gone through numerous controversies around the issue, it looks for candidates who are gender-neutral.

Avoid gender specific pronouns like *he* or *she*. The easiest way to work around the issue is by always referring someone by name. In case if you don't remember, just make up one. Google is an incredibly liberal company where everyone is accepted. Your answers must be ethical and respectful to anyone.

### Laszlo's definition
Laszlo Block, a former VP of Google, defined Googliness as four attributes.

#### 1. Enjoying fun
Google employees work hard, but they also love fun. If you can add anecdotes of how you *energized* your team through simple things like going for pools with colleagues or blasting some ACDC songs on Friday morning, it will add a point to your Googliness scale.

#### 2. Intellectual humility
It's hard to learn if you have hard time admitting that you might be wrong. Humbleness and your commitment to grow and learn more are good ways of showing intellectual humility. Moreover, a person with this attribute is collaborates with colleagues to make right decisions and keen observations that lead to innovations. Stories such as helping others take lead, accepting advices of somebody else, or trusting your colleagues that they have the skill sets to do the job are good examples. Constantly talk about learning throughout the interview.

#### 3. Conscientiousness
Google looks for candidates with high standards. **Never make excuses** and own everything that you say during the interview. Talk about how you can improve throughout your career, like taking continuing education courses, reading books, or even your listening skills. Any sign of improving yourself constantly will score high on the scale.

#### 4. Interesting Path
This attribute is about taking courageous or interesting path in your life. Talk about how you made a challenging decision that made you learn lessons. The result is not important; what matters is the process itself and how much you have grown through it. Personally, I self-taught coding from 2018 and eventually ended up gaining a decent coding skill through self discipline and perseverance. Having an unique autobiography is one thing that Google seeks.

### Google's definition
This is how Google defines Googliness on the careers' page:

#### 1. Working individually & team
Focusing on what you did and what you would do in answers is a top priority, but also be mindful of your team's strength. Giving credits to your team exhibits that you are a team-player and how much you put importance on collaboration with others.

#### 2. How you help others
Caring and helping others is a core principle of Googliness that shines your leadership. Your story could be either personal or career-related and focus on talking about how you helped, listened, and showed empathy and compassion. Don't forget to mention what you learned from the experience.

#### 3. Ambiguity
Googliness is about finding joy and embracing uncertainty. Interviews will challenge your problem solving skills with limited information. Google looks for candidates who can positively respond and find joy in navigating unknown without being frustrated. Even if there are struggles and difficulties, if you can maintain positivity in tone and pitch and put your best effort to navigate through the ambiguity, you're a future Googler.

#### 4. Pushing yourself out of comfort zone
Google wants to see if you strive to grow and learn. Stories like taking continuing education courses and stretching yourself to volunteer to a project that's outside of your skills and knowledge help, but showing growth during the interview really shines. If you struggle at beginning but continue to work through the interview, it really shows how you push yourself out of the comfort zone.

#### 5. EQ
EQ is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict. Think about how interviewers feel and empathize with them throughout the interviews. Finding common grounds with them will impress them to think that you are a right fit for the company.

I know that it's been a long article to read, but I tried my best to summarize the core principles for a Google interview. If you can express these attributes in your responses, you will be doing an excellent job on the interview day. Thanks for reading!

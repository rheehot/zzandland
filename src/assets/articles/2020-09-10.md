As I have an upcoming *virtual* onsite interview with Google, I decided to write a post on what is **Googleyness** based on various sources. Interestingly, many sources define Googleyness in their own terms, so I tried my best to find core principles that are mentioned frequently. Here is a summary of what I found.

First of all, here are a list of *keywords* that you'd like to frame your answers with:
> Positivity, Friendliness, Team Player, Transparent, Life Long Learner, Respectful, Valuing Yourself & Others, High Standards, Ethical, Humble, Committed, Trustworthy, Helpful, Integrity, Fun, Courteous, Caring, Passionate, Playful, Energetic, High EQ

### Do the right thing
In other words, *don't do **evil** things*. Google strives to hire people who are honest and kind. Of course having good manner matters in any company, but it especially matters in Google. There are several ways that you can appeal that you are a good person who *does right thing* during the interview.

The first way is how you **interact** with people that you encounter during the hiring process, such as interviewers, recruiters, or even receptionists when you visit the office for onsite stage. Make sure to leave good impressions.

Second way is in the answers. Your answers should be completely **transparent** (~~not in a way that discloses your current company's secrets~~) and show a ton of **integrity**. If your answers reflect these two ideas, you will ace in behavioural questions.

### Choice of words
Using right words can make your answers strong and more customized to what Google is looking for. Three things to remember are: positivity, gender-free, and political-correctness.

Be **positive**. Positivity is very important in Google because negativity only brings people down. There are even some Googlers who do not respond to anything that is not positive. Make sure to use positive words in all of your answers. For example, instead of saying *problem*, you can phrase it as *opportunity*. *Mistake* can be worded to *learning opportunity*. When you talk about your failure, phrase it as how this *learning opportunity* has changed you to adapt and adjust your career. **Googleyness** is about seeing everything **positive**.

Be careful with using gender-specific pronouns. Google employs more than 100,000 people with diverse backgrounds, including gender neutrals and non binaries. Therefore, it is important to avoid describing anyone using gender specific pronouns like *he* or *she*. The easiest way to avoid this is by always using the actual name or just make up names in case if you do not remember. 

Google is an incredibly liberal company where everyone is accepted. Your answers must be ethical and respectful to anyone.
